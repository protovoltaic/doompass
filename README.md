# doompass
The original Dr. Doom password generator

Generates secure passwords based on the variable and function naming convention from Dr. Doom's proprietary Doombot assembly code in *The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl (2015)* #4.

## Rules:
Passwords are always some form of "Doom":

1. The first character is *d* or *D*.
1. The middle is filled out with a random number of *o*'s, *O*'s, and zeros.
1. The last character is *m* or *M*.

According to the source material, a four character password would work. This implementation pads out the middle section for better security.
